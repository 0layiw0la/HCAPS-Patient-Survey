The response rate of the survey across the country seems to be on a steady decline from 2015 till 2023, with it's response rate reaching an all time low of 23.23% in 2023.



## Top 5 states by response rate 
The chart below shows the average response rate between 2015 till 2023 for the 5 states with the highest response rate. XX is the state with the highest response rate followed by xx,xx,xx and xx in order.



What is interesting to note is that although South Dakota is the fifth state by response rate it is the only one among the top five which does not have a steadily declining rate as response rates increased from 2021 to 2022 before falling again
